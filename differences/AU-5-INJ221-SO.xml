  <description>
    <narrative>Funding under this initiative provides funding through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to provide critical humanitarian assistance, livelihood support and medical care to civilians affected by conflict.  Despite security challenges in Somalia, the ICRC has maintained a strong presence and high operational capacity in Somalia since 1982 through its strict principles of neutrality and independence, regular contact with all parties to the conflict, and a longstanding and close relationship with its Somali field officers and the Somalia Red Crescent Society. Funding under this initiative is also provided to United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) to provide vital support to the provision of security to humanitarian workers in Somalia. The total value of this initiative is $5.5 million expensed during 1 financial year, 2009-10.</narrative>
