      <description type="1" diff:insert="">
        <narrative>Aims to ensure more effective humanitarian interventions by strengthening the evidence base on the impact of cash and voucher-based food assistance to prevent undernutrition in emergencies. Primary outcomes expected are:(1) the creation of high-quality, relevant research that fills gaps in the evidence base;(2) the accessibility of results and evidence to both technical and non-technical audiences;and (3) the successful uptake of REFANI research by key stakeholders in policy and practice.</narrative>
