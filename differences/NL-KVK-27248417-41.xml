  <description xmlns:ns6="http://akvo.org/iati-activities" diff:insert="" type="1" diff:add-attr="type;{http://akvo.org/iati-activities}type" ns6:type="6">The Republic of Somaliland is situated on the tip of the Horn of Africa. Somaliland was formed in 1991 after separating from southern Somalia following 3 years of civil war but the country still awaits international recognition.

During the war many people fled the area. Many have now returned, yet no longer have a house to go back to. The people stay at an IDP camp near the city of Burao, where there are no facilities whatsoever available. The latrines will improve health conditions within the camp.

As such it is in need of a permanent sanitation solution. The people affected will build and maintain the latrines themselves. Furthermore, training, education and awareness raising are also part of the project. </description>
