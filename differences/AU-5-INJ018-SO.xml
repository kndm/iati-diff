    <narrative>The Australia-Africa Partnerships Facility provides a flexible and responsive way to meet the development assistance requests of up to 53 African countries. Under this facility Australia is providing modest capacity building assistance for mining, agriculture and public policy requests in the form of deployments of people, exchanges of people between Australian and African organisations, training, workshops, seminars and grant funding. The total value of this multi-country initiative is $125.0 million over 6 years, starting 2009-10.</narrative>
