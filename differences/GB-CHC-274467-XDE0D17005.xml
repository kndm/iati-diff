ActionAid will also build the capacity of women affected by the drought to develop community based protection plans. Spaces will be created to actively involve them in the design and implementation of women led local level protection responses, provide psychosocial counselling to women affected by GBV, and provide support and linkages to referral mechanisms and institutions including medical and legal support. Safe spaces in schools through the girls’ forums and at food and water distribution points for women will be utilized. Dignity kits to affected women and girls will be provided. The project will also strengthen accountability in the drought response. ActionAid realise the important role that participation and inclusion, information sharing, complaints and resolution mechanism and holding others to account plays in promoting accountability in delivery of emergency response.</narrative>
