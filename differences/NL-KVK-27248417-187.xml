The Winddrinker combines a windmill and a desalination pump in the most efficient way. The technology is developed by researchers of the Delft University of Technology. At this moment we are developing a prototype that will produce an average of 60.000 liters per day healthy drink water for use in Somaliland. It is thé promising solution to solve water problems in dry coastal areas of developing countries.</description>
      <description xmlns:ns8="http://akvo.org/iati-activities" diff:insert="" type="1" diff:add-attr="type;{http://akvo.org/iati-activities}type" ns8:type="6">As mentioned before, the scarcity of clean drinking water links to all kinds of other economic, political and social problems.
And water is scarce. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) there is abundant evidence that fresh water resources are vulnerable and have the potential to be strongly impacted by climate change. Water scarcity in East Africa is the worst

Kenya, Djibouti, Somaliland all have enormous water scarcity and water quality problems. We can be assured that this situation will only become worse.

The ‘Republic of Somaliland’ was created on 18 May 1991. The new Somaliland encompasses the territory of the former British protectorate which borders Djibouti, the Gulf of Aden, Ethiopia and Somalia. Somaliland broke away from the former Italian protectorate Somalia.

      <description xmlns:ns9="http://akvo.org/iati-activities" diff:insert="" type="1" diff:add-attr="type;{http://akvo.org/iati-activities}type" ns9:type="7">Executive summary of the project:

The world’s water crisis is one of the major challenges of our time. The lack of water is strongly linked, and negatively impacted, by Climate Change, rapid population growth, soaring energy prices and the financial crisis. As a consequence, the impact of diarrheal diseases for children is bigger than the impact of HIV, Aids, Malaria and tuberculosis combined.

The Winddrinker Holding will commercialize a wind driven desalination technology developed by the Delft University of Technology, the Winddrinker. With this technology people in developing countries get access to cheap and affordable water. A windmill is directly coupled, mechanically, with a Reversed Osmosis desalination technology. The system eliminates the use of, expensive, batteries; wind energy is virtually stored as fresh water. This reduces the capital and maintenance costs and reduces environmental impact while increasing the overall efficiency and reliability of the system. A software program has been designed to optimize the Winddrinker for each specific location.
Based on wind and water data this program designs the cheapest system given a specific output.
Our mean strategy to bring this technology on the market in developing countries is through stimulation of local entrepreneurship. Local entrepreneurs can set-up franchise businesses following our unique implementation triangle. Beside access to the Winddrinker technology they get access to capital and education. Revenues from the franchises for the Holding will be created primary through shareholders dividends and interest on loans. 

The global market is extremely large. From small Islands in South-East Asia to extremely dry areas in Africa, as long as there is a lack of fresh water and sufficient wind and salt water, the Winddrinker offers a competitive solution. Our mean initial focus is on east Africa, one of the world’s areas that is the hardest hit by drought. East Africa alone already has a market for more than 850 Winddrinkers.
To demonstrate the Winddrinker and the implementation triangle we will start-up a local pilot franchise in Berbera, Somaliland (an autonomous and safe region in North Somalia).
This local franchise will operate under the name Malao Waters. The severe water stress, favorable wind conditions and our well established network make this area a favorable area to start. The system design for Somaliland, will produce 60.000l a day. A local entrepreneur will sell the water initially in bulk at the pump at a competitive price of 0,5 Eurocents/litre, After an additional investment also bottled jerry cans of 20 litre will be sold. The investment in the windmill can be earned back easily in 5 years while making a positive net profit. When paying the shareholders Malao Waters can still save enough money to buy a second windmill within 5 years.

      <description xmlns:ns10="http://akvo.org/iati-activities" diff:insert="" type="1" diff:add-attr="type;{http://akvo.org/iati-activities}type" ns10:type="9">The project contains three phases: 
1) Winddrinker Pilot Testing: The Winddrinker (windmill, pump, RO) transported and installed locally at a suitable place. The well and storage tanks are constructed and suitable for operation. The mill is now ready for a testing period of 2 months to collect data and make improvements in needed. Funding requested is for phase 1 only.
2) Malao Waters Start-up: The local enterprise Malao Waters will be established. A local entrepreneur will receive ownership of the company and is responsible for management and operation. The first employees are hired. 
3)  Scale-up and diversification: Phase 3 starts if the technology and the company are running steady. This is the time to scale up the sales with an increased sales force, but also to diversify the product portfolio by installing a bottling line and set-up sales of vitamins as additives.</description>

Salt water and wind are available for free. 

The Winddrinker produces clean drinking water by desalinating salt water. The process is entirely powered by wind energy, resulting in a zero emission solution. The movement of the windmill is mechanically transferred to the desalination pump. The system is more efficient than current windmill-desalination systems, as no energy is lost in conversion to electricity.

2- To proof the business model where local entrepreneurs will get access to the technology, to capital and to education in order to be copied in other regions
3- Give access to affordable and healthy drinking water which limits the health risks involved with drinking currently available water of bad quality.
